# This doesn't work

I'm trying to build a component for homeassistant to display the gold price of an specific amount of gold.
I thought that would be a easy startin project to learn how these components work.
I used [this blueprint](https://github.com/custom-components/integration_blueprint/) and changed a few things to work with [this API](https://www.goldapi.io/),
but apparrendly I'm missing something...
