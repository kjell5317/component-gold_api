# This does not work

I'm trying to build a component for Home Assistant to display the gold price of a specific amount of gold.
I thought that would be an easy starting project to learn how these components work.
I used [this blueprint](https://github.com/custom-components/integration_blueprint/) and changed a few things to work with [this API](https://www.goldapi.io/),
but apparently I'm missing something...
